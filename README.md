# interactive-mason-jar
Final project for NYU ITP Camp Summer 2021

 Built using CircuitPython and a CircuitPlayground Express, a US-100 Ultrasonic Sensor, a "hamburger" speaker, two alligator clips, some wire, and a 20 pixel neopixel strand.
 Turn the device on and you hear a startup sound and animation.
 Appraoch the sensor & more lights randomly go on with increasing brightness and a twinkle sound (that should be improved).
 Move away and lights are extinguished the further away you are, with an accompanying pop sound for each extinguished light.
 Box designed using MakerCase.com, then modified in Adobe Illustrator and laser cut onto 1/8" black acryllic.
 Mason jar and diffusion beads bought from Michael's Craft Center.
 Rubber feat attached beneath the box.
 All but the top side of the box glued using clear Gorilla Glue (acryllic glue would have been better).
